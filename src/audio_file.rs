//! Provides the `AudioFile` abstraction for handling audio stream playback.
//!
//! This module implements a unified interface for both encrypted and unencrypted audio files,
//! providing buffered reading optimized for media playback. All downloads are wrapped in
//! a 32 KiB buffer, with additional 2 KiB block processing for encrypted content.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use pleezer::audio_file::AudioFile;
//! use std::io::{Read, Seek, SeekFrom};
//!
//! // Create audio file, handling potential errors
//! let mut audio = AudioFile::try_from_download(&track, download)?;
//!
//! // Check if seeking is supported
//! if audio.is_seekable() {
//!     audio.seek(SeekFrom::Start(1000))?;
//! }
//!
//! // Read data, handling I/O errors
//! let mut buf = vec![0; 1024];
//! match audio.read(&mut buf) {
//!     Ok(n) => println!("Read {n} bytes"),
//!     Err(e) => eprintln!("Read error: {e}"),
//! }
//! ```
